# OSImager Secrets File
# Location: ~/.config/osimager/secrets
# Setup: mkosimage --set credential_source=config
#
# Format: path key=value key=value ...
#
# The path corresponds to how specs and platform configs reference secrets.
# There are two types of paths:
#
#   images/<os>           - OS image credentials used by all builds of that
#                           OS type. Referenced in spec files (e.g.
#                           specs/linux/spec.json). The username/password are
#                           used for SSH or WinRM access during the build, and
#                           for setting the root/admin password in kickstart/
#                           preseed/autoinst templates.
#
#   <platform>/<location> - Platform credentials for a specific location.
#                           Referenced in platform files (e.g.
#                           platforms/vsphere.json). The <location> matches
#                           the location name you use in the build target:
#                           mkosimage <platform>/<location>/<spec>
#
# Copy this file to ~/.config/osimager/secrets and fill in your values.

# Image credentials (required for all builds)
images/linux username=root password=Ch@ng3m3
images/windows username=Administrator password=Ch@ng3m3

# vSphere credentials (one entry per location that uses vsphere)
# e.g. for "mkosimage vsphere/lab/..." the path is vsphere/lab
vsphere/lab server=vcenter.example.com username=administrator@vsphere.local password=Ch@ng3m3
vsphere/esx server=esxhost1.example.com username=root password=Ch@ng3m3

# Proxmox credentials (one entry per location that uses proxmox)
# e.g. for "mkosimage proxmox/pnet/..." the path is proxmox/pnet
proxmox/pnet server=proxmox.example.com username=root@pam password=Ch@ng3m3
